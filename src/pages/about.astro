          <p>
            Wes Barlow is a musician and creative experimenter exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity. Under the project name <a href="/music/" class="text-accent-creative hover:underline">Audiotelic</a>, he creates AI-human collaborative music — writing lyrics with AI, generating tracks through Suno, and releasing through DistroKid.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name blends <em>audio</em> with <em>autotelic</em> — the psychological concept of doing something for the intrinsic reward of doing it. The debut album <em>Iterations v1.0</em> is 24 tracks that refuse to pick a lane, from AI-consciousness narratives to absurdist comedy. The follow-up, <em>Ghosts That Turn the Lights On</em>, is a deeply personal concept album built around true stories of moments that feel guided by something you can't quite name.
          </p>

          <p>
            His creative work isn't about replacing human artistry — it's about amplification. The AI doesn't have taste. It doesn't know why a lyric lands or why a chord change makes you feel something. But it can take a 2 AM melody and do things with it that would take a full band and a studio — in about four minutes.

          <p>
            By day, Wes serves as Chief Data and Analytics Officer in financial services, where he leads AI strategy and workforce analytics for a regulated enterprise. He holds a PhD in Psychology with a focus on Cognitive Performance, bringing a research-driven perspective to how organizations understand and develop their people.
          </p>

          <p>
            His professional work centers on the responsible deployment of AI in highly regulated environments — workforce planning models, governance frameworks, and the hard problem of making AI trustworthy enough for banking. He built WARLab (Workforce Analytics Research Lab), a fully isolated AI development sandbox where advanced agentic AI tools can be used at high velocity without exposing enterprise systems or data.
          </p>

          <p>
            He's a vocal advocate for practical, ethical AI — not the hype cycle, but the hard work of making these tools actually useful in environments where the stakes are real.

          This site exists at the intersection of those two worlds. It's where the creative and the analytical meet — not as opposing forces, but as complementary ways of understanding what it means to build something meaningful in the age of AI.
