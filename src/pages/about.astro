          <p>
            Wes Barlow is a writer, musician, and audio producer exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity. His debut novel, <em>The Oakwood Murders</em>, is a neo-noir mystery that blends classic hardboiled storytelling with contemporary psychological realism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under multiple artist personas — Roxy (trip-hop/noir-jazz), Lilly (indie-folk/ethereal), and Wes (synthwave/electronic) — he creates AI-generated music that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with tools like Suno. His audio production work spans dramas, audiobooks, and podcasts, all leveraging AI voice synthesis through platforms like Fish Audio and ElevenLabs.
          </p>

          <p>
            His creative work isn't about replacing human artistry — it's about discovering what becomes possible when human vision meets machine capability.

        <div class="space-y-4 text-text-secondary font-body leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            By day, Wes serves as Chief Data and Analytics Officer in financial services, where he leads AI strategy and workforce analytics for a regulated enterprise. He holds a PhD in Psychology with a focus on Industrial-Organizational Psychology, bringing a research-driven perspective to how organizations understand and develop their people.
          </p>

          <p>
            His professional work centers on the responsible deployment of AI in highly regulated environments — synthetic data generation, workforce planning models, and the governance frameworks that make AI trustworthy enough for banking. He built WARLab (Workforce Analytics Advanced Research Lab), an AWS-based AI development sandbox for HR analytics.
          </p>

          <p>
            He's a vocal advocate for practical, ethical AI — not the hype cycle, but the hard work of making these tools actually useful in environments where the stakes are real.
