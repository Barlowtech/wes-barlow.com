            Wes Barlow has been making things for as long as he can remember. He's built tube amps, played guitar and piano in bands, and written and directed short films — some of which won awards. The creative impulse has always been there; the medium just keeps changing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The latest iteration is <a href="/music/" class="text-accent-creative hover:underline">Audiotelic</a>, a multidisciplinary music project that blends <em>audio</em> with <em>autotelic</em> — the psychological concept of doing something for the intrinsic reward of doing it. He writes lyrics collaboratively with AI, generates tracks through Suno, and releases through DistroKid. The debut album <em>Iterations v1.0</em> is 24 tracks that refuse to pick a lane, from AI-consciousness narratives to absurdist comedy. The follow-up, <em>Ghosts That Turn the Lights On</em>, is a deeply personal concept album built around true stories of moments that feel guided by something you can't quite name.
          </p>

          <p>
            His creative work isn't about replacing human artistry — it's about amplification. The AI doesn't have taste. It doesn't know why a lyric lands or why a chord change makes you feel something. But it can take a 2 AM melody and do things with it that would take a full band and a studio — in about four minutes.

          <p>
            By day, Wes serves as Chief Data and Analytics Officer in financial services, where he leads AI strategy and workforce analytics for a regulated enterprise. He holds a PhD in Psychology with a focus on Cognitive Performance, bringing a research-driven perspective to how organizations understand and develop their people.
          </p>

          <p>
            He got into language modeling before it was fashionable — back when TF-IDF was standard and Word2Vec and GloVe were the cutting edge. That early NLP work shaped how he thinks about the field today: less hype, more craft. His professional work centers on the responsible deployment of AI in highly regulated environments — workforce planning models, governance frameworks, and the hard problem of making AI trustworthy enough for banking.
          </p>

          <p>
            He built WARLab (Workforce Analytics Research Lab), a fully isolated AI development sandbox where advanced agentic AI tools can be used at high velocity without exposing enterprise systems or data. He's a vocal advocate for practical, ethical AI — not the hype cycle, but the hard work of making these tools actually useful in environments where the stakes are real.

          This site exists at the intersection of those two worlds. It's where the creative and the analytical meet — not as opposing forces, but as complementary ways of understanding what it means to build something meaningful in the age of AI.
