For a while now, I've been running two AI coding agents in parallel. One acts as a builder—the workhorse that writes and ships code. The other is more of an always-on assistant, the tool I interact with constantly throughout the day. And like any tool you use constantly, I keep a running list of improvements I'd like to make to it. Updates, fixes, new features, quality-of-life tweaks.

The problem is that list grows faster than I can implement it. It's like mowing a lawn that grows back while you're still pushing the mower. Every time I check something off, three more ideas land at the bottom.

So one evening I had what felt like a brilliant idea—the kind that sounds great at 11 PM and questionable by morning. What if I pointed the builder at the assistant and let them work it out? Not just blindly copying code and hoping for the best—I set up a real feedback loop. Picture two brain surgeons operating on each other. One performs the procedure, then the other one wakes up and they see if it worked. If it did, great—move on to the next item on the list. If it didn't, they huddle up and refine the approach. And if the one on the table doesn't wake up after a few minutes? They reset to the last known working version and start again. Nobody panics. Very professional.

I set the loop running, went to bed, and felt like a genius.

I woke up to four emails from OpenRouter.

See, I have my account set to automatically refill fifty dollars in credits whenever the balance drops below five. Handy feature. Very responsible. Unless, of course, you leave two AI agents unsupervised with an open tab. While I slept, they burned through credit after credit, triggering refill after refill. Four times. Over two hundred dollars in tokens, charged in neat little fifty-dollar increments—like a bar tab you don't see until closing time.

But here's where the story gets interesting.

Not only had they knocked out a serious chunk of my never-ending task list, they'd also run into a fundamental problem and solved it creatively. The big fix? They built a standalone application to act as a bridge between the two systems. Nobody asked them to do that. They identified the bottleneck, architected a solution, and built a custom, OS-agnostic standalone app—all on their own, all before my alarm went off.

Pretty ingenious, actually. Like hiring a plumber to fix a leak and coming home to find they've replumbed your entire house. Unexpected, sure. But also... kind of exactly what you needed.

And that reframes the two-hundred-dollar surprise. Yes, I woke up to four charge notifications before breakfast. But what I got was a custom-built application and a pile of completed improvements. I'm not sure what the going rate for that kind of work is in 2026, but I know that two years ago, there would have been a lot more zeros in that number. It's like complaining about the electric bill after your robots cleaned the whole house overnight.

So would I do it again? I already am. But this time with a spending cap—and maybe an alarm set for when the third refill email hits.
