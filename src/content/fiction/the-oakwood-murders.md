## About the Novel

*The Oakwood Murders* is a neo-noir mystery set in the fictional suburb of Oakwood — a place where manicured lawns conceal decades of buried secrets. When retired detective Harlan Cole's neighbor turns up dead in circumstances that mirror an unsolved case from twenty years ago, Cole is pulled back into a world he thought he'd left behind.

The novel weaves multiple POV narratives through a web of deception, institutional corruption, and the quiet violence of suburban respectability. Drawing from the tradition of Raymond Chandler and James Ellroy while grounding itself in contemporary psychological realism, *The Oakwood Murders* explores what happens when the past refuses to stay buried.

## Status

Currently in active development. First draft is in progress with revision planned for early 2026. The story is being developed alongside a companion audio drama adaptation.

## Characters

The story follows an ensemble cast anchored by Harlan Cole, a detective whose retirement was less a choice than a surrender. Supporting characters include Elena Voss, a journalist whose investigation into Oakwood's history puts her on a collision course with powerful interests, and Marcus Webb, a city councilman whose public charm masks private desperation.

## Writing Process

This novel is being written using a hybrid AI-assisted workflow — leveraging Claude for outlining, character development, and revision, while maintaining human creative direction throughout. It's as much an experiment in the future of fiction writing as it is a story about the past.
